# Changelog

Trikey is pre-alpha and not audited. Each release has a guardian image
(`ghcr.io/theicaruswings/trikey-guardian`, pinned by digest in the
[Umbrel community store](https://github.com/TheIcarusWings/trikey-umbrel-store)) and an Android test APK on its
[GitHub release](https://github.com/TheIcarusWings/trikey/releases). How to install and test:
[docs/alpha-test-plan.md](docs/alpha-test-plan.md).

## Unreleased

## 0.1.4-alpha (2026-10-30)

- **App: fixes the Android APK closing as soon as it opens** (every APK from 0.1.0). The Trezor link loads
  `@sinclair/typebox`, whose ES build declares a top-level `var Object` that breaks once Metro turns it into
  CommonJS; the app now uses typebox's CommonJS build (#34).
- CI opens every PR's APK in an Android emulator and fails on a crash at start, with the crash log on the PR
  (#34).
- Guardian: after a crash the process exits with 1, not 0, so Umbrel's `restart: on-failure` brings it back
  instead of leaving the app at 502 (#30).
- Recovery Key: the kit's word-check positions are picked uniformly (entropy review I4, #33).

## 0.1.3-alpha (2026-10-30)

- **Guardian: fixes the guardian stopping right after setup** ("Maximum call stack size exceeded") when a
  nostr relay could not be reached. nostr-tools' relay calls `close()` from its own error handler and Node's
  WebSocket fires the error again from inside `close()`; every relay pool now uses a WebSocket whose
  `close()` runs once (#29).
- Guardian: reports its real version (it said 0.1.0).
- Guardian web: the passphrase works with password managers (Proton Pass, 1Password, Bitwarden, iCloud,
  Google): one saved entry fills setup, unlock, sign-in and reset, and setup can use a generated passphrase
  (#27).
- Design proposal for passkey sign-in and unlock: [docs/design/passkey-unlock.md](docs/design/passkey-unlock.md)
  (#28).

## 0.1.2-alpha (2026-10-30)

- **Guardian: fixes the image not starting** ("Cannot find package 'zod'"): 0.1.0-alpha and 0.1.1-alpha left
  a dependency out of the image. CI now starts the built image and waits for `/api/status` before a release
  (#23).
- Security, from the [entropy review](docs/security/entropy-review.md):
  - new guardian setup seeds mix in 32 bytes from the setup browser and, on Umbrel, the app's `APP_SEED`, so a
    predictable guardian generator alone no longer gives key 3 (M1, #24);
  - a stricter randomness lint (L1, #21);
  - a gift wrap's public expiration no longer reveals when it was sent (L2, #20);
  - an RNG health test and crypto known-answer tests before any key is made, on the guardian and the phone
    (L3, #22).
- Umbrel: the app ships its `data` folder so the guardian (uid 1000) can write its state (#11).
- Guardian: a data folder it cannot write is refused at once, saying whose it is (#12).
- App: a network strip on every screen on test networks and in the demo (#13), AA contrast and 44 pt targets
  (#19), "Review" on the amount screen and Copy first on Receive.
- Guardian web: the same network strip across the top on test networks (#14).
- Docs: the test plan covers installing from the community store and testing on mainnet or a test network
  (#18).

## 0.1.1-alpha (2026-10-30)

- Mainnet in guardian mode, behind a pre-alpha warning the tester must accept; Recovery Key mode stays on test
  networks (#8).
- Guardian: silent payment scanning on several CPU cores (`SP_SCAN_THREADS`), falling back to one thread if
  the workers cannot start.
- App: haptics, Send max, Wallet details (the descriptor, to recover in another wallet), Report a problem,
  Android back no longer leaves no-going-back screens, a button to the setting when Bluetooth is off or its
  permission was refused, the recovery's line for coins that arrive late.

## 0.1.0-alpha (2026-10-30)

- First pre-release: the phone app (guardian mode and Recovery Key mode), the guardian with its web UI, the
  Umbrel and Start9 packages, and the Android test APK.
- Known issue: the guardian image cannot start (fixed in 0.1.2-alpha).
